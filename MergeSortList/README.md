Merge Sort on Linked Lists Student Support Code

Revision: Fall 2023

Question 1: The time complexity of the merge function is O(n^2) as it has two for loops where one is inside the other
and the space complexity is O(n)

Question 2: The time complexity of the sort function is O(n^2) as it has two for loops where one is inside the other.
and the space complexity is O(n)

Question 3: The time complexity for the merge_in_place function is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n)

Question 4: the time complexity for the sort_in_place function is O(nlogn) and the space complexity is O(n)
